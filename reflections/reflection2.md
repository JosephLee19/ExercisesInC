Spring 2 Reflection:

Progress towards my explicitely stated personal learning goal (becoming more familair with C so that I can take on an focussed and well scoped 2nd project) was somewhat slow during this sprint. I think that there were two main reasons for this.  The first was that with another team member dropping the class, our man-hours are now down to half of what they were at the start of our project. This has made it more difficult to properly balance time spent on the project vs. time spent on exercises (eventually we mitigated this by shifting our project scope to accomodate this change). I think that the second reason for this break down was a failure on my part to approach the exercises in a systematic way. In combination with the project feeling overwhelming and trying to catch up on the exercises for the readings, I took 'shortcuts' that I shouldn't have (completing portions of exercises in order of increasing difficulty rather than in order of most helpful to least helpful or chronologically). Basically, trying to get as much 'volume' of work done rather than the most learning.

Discussing reading questions/exercises with my team during class has proven to be extremely helpful, and I think that continued implementation of this will help work against the problems I mentioned above. Another thing that we have implemented moving into sprint 3 to help with this is assigning due dates to many of the tasks on our trello card (including which readings/exercises should be done when). This will provide an internal schedule for myself as well as a degree of accountability to make sure it gets done on time.

A final thing that I noticed in sprint 2 is that there were times that I would be working on an exercise for an excessive amount of time without really getting very far. This resulted in me putting in significant time into this class, without seeing significant results. I need to be careful to bang my head against a problem enough to really understand what is going on, but not so much that it is beyond the point of diminishing returns.


Head First C Exercises:

I read chapter 3 in HFC a second time to try to retain it better, as well as read chapter 4. I am still working on trying to catch up on the exercises and have not gotten to HFC exercise 3.  I did compelte [HFC exercise 4](https://github.com/JosephLee19/ExercisesInC/tree/master/exercises/ex04/trout), however. I apologize about the github messiness, something weird happened when I tried to commit and I am still trying to figure out how to fix it.

Think OS Readings and Questions:
I read chapters 4 and 5 during sprint 2, but again am still trying to catch up on the questions.  I have completed [chapter 4 reading questions](https://github.com/JosephLee19/ExercisesInC/blob/master/reading_questions/thinkos.md)
