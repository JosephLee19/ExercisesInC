Reflection for Sprint 1:
After each sprint, you will submit a reflection document with the following sections:

Written sprint reflection
Links to your solutions to Head First C exercises
Written answers to reading questions from Think OS
Exam question(s) and solutions
 

Written sprint reflection

In your sprint reflections, you should focus on your personal learning goals and take a look back on what went well/poorly during the previous sprint. For things that did not go well, have your interventions from the retrospective improved things?

For Reflection 1, you should focus on the process of Sprint 1 after Reflection 0. How did your team follow or adapt the eduScrum ceremonies? How did your work prepare you for the sprint review, and in what ways were you unprepared? How did your activity throughout the sprint change from what you expected at the beginning as you worked toward your project proposal?

 

Links to Head First C exercises

List the chapters you worked on during this sprint and provide links to your solutions (code, Markdown notes/answers, etc). If you did not complete any HFC exercises during this sprint, explain what you did instead. Since this work also lives within your ExercisesInC repository, you can use relative links (Links to an external site.) for portability.

 

Think OS reading question answers

List the chapters you worked on during this sprint and provide your answers to reading questions, either inline or as links to separate Markdown documents. If you did not complete any TOS exercises during this sprint, explain what you did instead.

 

Exam question(s) and solution

One of the best ways to learn is to teach someone else, and a good way to check that you truly understand a concept is to pose your own question testing it. In each reflection, you will write (at least one) original, non-trivial question testing the material you read during the previous sprint, along with your solution. You should also indicate what reading(s) your question draws upon.

These questions may be helpful to use within your team to help prepare for sprint reviews. We will also share the compiled set of questions as a study guide for the midterm and final exams.
